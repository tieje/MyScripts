Input needed in order:
1. Location of scripts to run.
	Press Enter if the command line is already in the correct directory.
	- If a "zz_drive_[0-9] file exists in the folder, then only run this instead.
2. Check for a spool for each script. If there is no spool in the first line, then run the spool command before running the script.
3. Run the script.
	Next run the mhklogchecker
	If there is an error, print the error_results.txt file
	    If it's a zz_drive_[0-9] file, then it won't paste
4. If there is a "grant to" prompt, input sc_base
5. Run the mhklogchecker.


Found hostname from the following query:
select host_name from v$instance

I won't be using sqlplus_commando python package because it's unfinished.
I'll look in to Popen, PIPE, and sys for python instead.
It will be a bit more learning, but I think it will be rewarding.
