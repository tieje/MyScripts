Page 118 is specific to the file design on a character basis so it's fairly accurate. Refer to that page instead of copying and pasting the information to this design doc.

The problems are the following:

MBI has no specified valid values in the Detail Record

I wouldn't worry so much about it. I'll put in the variables later.
