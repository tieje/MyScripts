Brainstorm

My case folders can be found in the following location on my computer:

C:\Users\tfrancis\OneDrive - Hearst\Cases

Client folders are usually defined by three letter words but there are exceptions
Within the client folder, a case folder titled with a given case number will be created with the following subfolders:

Code
	- I usually use a [case_number]_scratch.sql file for my personal use
Deployment
Documentation
	- For my level of work, I use a CDD. I might want to copy the CDD to this with the appropriate file name.

I'd like to go even further automate creating folder structures in subversion
http://subversion.apache.org/docs/

- Be able to run the script from the command line as a python script with the command "createcase.py"
	- Create a custom_script library and add it to user path

I'd like to make this in such a way that it's reusable throughout my career.

The main idea is to create folders wherever they need to be created.

The script createcase.py will make folders specifically for cases, but I guess I should create a question and answer kind of thing first and work from there. I'll call it, "createtree".

So I'll create createtree command first, then I'll create the createcase command.
