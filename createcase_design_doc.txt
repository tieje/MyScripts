Brainstorm

My case folders can be found in the following location on my computer:

C:\Users\tfrancis\OneDrive - Hearst\Cases

Client folders are usually defined by three letter words but there are exceptions
Within the client folder, a case folder titled with a given case number will be created with the following subfolders:

Code
	- I usually use a [case_number]_scratch.sql file for my personal use
Deployment
Documentation
	- For my level of work, I use a CDD. I might want to copy the CDD to this with the appropriate file name.

I'd like to go even further automate creating folder structures in subversion
http://subversion.apache.org/docs/

- Be able to run the script from the command line as a python script with the command "createcase.py"
	- Create a custom_script library and add it to user path

I'd like to make this in such a way that it's reusable throughout my career.

The main idea is to create folders wherever they need to be created.

The script createcase.py will make folders specifically for cases, but I guess I should create a question and answer kind of thing first and work from there. I'll call it, "createtree".

So I'll create createtree command first, then I'll create the createcase command.

The createtree.py command is finished. I will now create this specialized script.

Input: case number, client (three letter word), option argument of description

Output: Three folders in the Cases folder on my work computer path

Client folder
    Case Number - Case Description
        Code
        	- I usually use a [case_number]_scratch.sql file for my personal use
        Deployment
        Documentation
        	- For my level of work, I use a CDD. I might want to copy the CDD to this with the appropriate file name.

Analysis:

Cases folder # Will use a folder parameter at the top
    Client folder # will use Regex to choose best match based on input
					# If I can't find a match, ask for another input
						# If it can't find a match, a second time, the script will end.
					# Confirmation message: "For ____ [pick with the most matches] ___ would you like to create a case? Type 'y','yes', or spacebar, and Enter.
        Case Number - Case Description # "What is the case number?" If no case number, end the script.
										# "Description? (optional)"
            Code
            	- I usually use a [case_number]_scratch.sql file for my personal use
            Deployment
            Documentation # Have a parameter at the top to copy the CDD from your template folder and rename the copy with case number.
            	- For my level of work, I use a CDD. I might want to copy the CDD to this with the appropriate file name.

As a nice visual touch:
	either: give the folder path of this case and ask to copy and paste this in File Explorer,
	Or: open up Windows File Explorer to this new location.

The second mini project will be to extend this function by creating folders in SVN and check them out to this folder in SVN.
This might be hard.
