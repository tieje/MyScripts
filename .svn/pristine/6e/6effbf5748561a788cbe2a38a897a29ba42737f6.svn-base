This script will need to work on multiple computers.

absolute path at the top
fairly simple and straightforward
Two questions:
"Would you like to create your script in the default location? If not, paste the script location."
"What would you like this script to be called?"

The bottom of the script will contain a main.

The top of the script will contain a class that hass been automatically generated. I'll need to write code to the file which is doable, but I haven't done this before.
