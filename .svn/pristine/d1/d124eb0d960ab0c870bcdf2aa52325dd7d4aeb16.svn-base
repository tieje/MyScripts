It's a private repo, so you'll need to ask me for permission to see it.

- Download and install python 3.7
	- Check the "Add python to PATH" box when installing python.
- Keep all the scripts in one folder.
	- Add this new folder to PATH in Environment Variables
- ALWAYS Read the corresponding README file in the Readmes folder for the scripts that you would like to use. Only a few require downloading special packages.
- Run the script in the windows cmd prompt by typing the entire file name including the ".py" and press Enter.
- ???
- Profit.


- If you would like to run scripts without installing python, please contact Thomas Francis. The solution is to use a python package called pyInstaller to create an executable file.
