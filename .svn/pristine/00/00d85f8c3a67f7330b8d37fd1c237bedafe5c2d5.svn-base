The purpose of this script is to automatically create a script template every time I want to write a new script.

This script asks two questions.
The first, either press Enter, enter 'y', or enter 'yes' to use the default script location; OR paste and enter the custom location that you would like to use.
The second question is about file naming. Call it as you normally would: type whole words and spaces. The code is made to handle this.

- python 3.7
- must be in the same folder as createtree.py
- This is a convenience script for me.
