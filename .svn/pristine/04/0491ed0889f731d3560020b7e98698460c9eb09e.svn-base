createtree was made as a general file and folder creator that will essentially be the base code for specialized folder and file creators in the future

Questions this will ask:
Please copy and paste the directory in which you would like to create folders and files, then press Enter. If the command prompt is already on the correct root directory press Enter.

In ______ sub-sub-folder, add file...

In ______ sub-x3-folder, add folder...

In ______ sub-x3-folder, add file...

The best way to solve this is recursively.
I'll need to review my recursion.
